During my position with Bank of Canada, I worked extensively with machine learning and data mining techniques to infer marketing insights and forecast sales. I was responsible for using data visualization techniques to increase the usability and accessibility of data for the sales and marketing departments. Working closely other departments allowed me to hone my interpersonal skills and the ability to present complex technical information to non-technical personnel.

It would be a pleasure to learn more about [company]â€™s expansion plans and provide further insight into how my highly developed data analytic abilities, experience managing large data sets, robust predictive analytics, and machine learning skills can help your company achieve these results. Some notable contributions to my previous employers include:

Used predictive analytics such as machine learning and data mining techniques to forecast company sales of new products with a 95\% accuracy rate.

Thank you for your time and for considering my candidacy for this position. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future to schedule an interview.
